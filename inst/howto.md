### Find the culvert

Start by locating the culvert (or bridge) you are interested in. You can zoom into the map by clicking **+** (zoom out with **&#x2212;**), using your mouse’s scroll wheel, or by pinching if you are on a mobile device. Drag the map to pan.

Alternatively, you can type an address or location. This can be a full street address or the name of a town, for example "otis mass."

Streams and culverts will appear once you’ve zoomed in far enough. If you don’t see them, zoom in a little farther.

### Get the MEP Cost Factor

Once you've located your culvert, click on it to get the MEP Cost Factor. A popup window will give you the MEP Cost Factor, the components that go into calculating it (habitat quality and connectivity restoration potential), the NAACC XYcode for the culvert, and the latitude and longitude. See **About MEP guidance** for an explanation of the MEP Cost Factor and a summary of how to interpret the information in the popup window.

Note that you can copy the text from the popup and paste it into a document or email. You can also copy just the numerical part of lat-long and paste it into the locate field in this tool or in Google maps to jump to the culvert.

### If the culvert isn't displayed

Some culverts aren't in the database. In general, missing culverts are on very small streams, but this can also be due to missing roads or other mapping errors. If the culvert is missing, you can click the stream where it should be to get the habitat quality score. For culverts that are not displayed in this tool, the connectivity restoration potential is "other" by default. See **About MEP guidance** for a summary of how to use this information.

### If the stream isn't displayed

Some streams, usually very small ones, are not mapped. If your culvert is on an unmapped stream then the habitat quality is "general" and the connectivity restoration potential is "other" by default. Fortunately, this should be quite rare.
