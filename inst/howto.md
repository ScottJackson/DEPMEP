### Find the culvert

Start by locating the culvert (or bridge) you're interested in. You can 
zoom into the map by clicking **+** (zoom out with **&#x2212;**), with your mouse's 
scroll wheel, or by pinching if you're on a mobile device. Drag the map to pan.

Alternatively, you can type an address or location. This can be a full street
address, the name of a town, for example "otis mass," or the name of a 
distinctive place, such as "umass," "boston," or "wachusett reservoir."

Streams and culverts will appear once you've zoomed in far enough. If you don't
see them, zoom in a little farther.

### Get the score

Once you've located your culvert, click on it to get the score. A popup window
will give you the MEP factor, the XYcode of the culvert, the latitude and 
longitude, and the components of the score. See **About MEP guidance** for a 
summary of how to interpret the score.

Note that you can copy the text from the popup and paste it into a document or 
email. You can also copy just the numerical part of lat-long and paste it into 
the locate field in this tool or in Google maps to jump to the culvert.

### If the culvert isn't displayed

Some culverts aren't in the database. In general, the missing culverts are
on very small streams, but this can also be due to missing roads or other 
mapping errors. If the culvert is missing, you can click the stream where it
should be to get the habitat quality score. See **About MEP guidance** for 
how to work with just a habitat quality score.

### If the stream isn't displayed

Some streams, usually very small ones, aren't mapped. If your culvert is
on an unmapped stream (and you're sure you're in the right place), you're 
out of luck. Fortunately, this should be quite rare.
